- Hi, I’m @DarthHyperion: Electrical engineering student and enterprising freelancer.
- Currently working on both front-end and back-end IC design.
- Experienced in Arduino and Arduino based systems.
- I dabble in writing in my free time.

As the great Engineer once said: "I'm an Engineer. That means I solve problems."
