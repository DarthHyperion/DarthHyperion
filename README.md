- Hi, I’m Muhammad Ali Farooq (@DarthHyperion): Electrical engineering student and enterprising freelancer.
- Currently working on both front-end IC design, and working on learning Deep Learning on the side. Will hopefully move towards working on a union of the two.
- Experienced in Arduino and Arduino based systems.
- I dabble in writing in my free time.

As the great Engineer once said: "I'm an Engineer. That means I solve problems."
